  "summary": "The NIST AI 100-1 document outlines the Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0), which aims to provide guidelines for managing risks associated with AI systems. It emphasizes the importance of understanding and addressing various risks, impacts, and challenges in AI risk management, including risk measurement and prioritization. The framework is designed to be a living document, with plans for regular updates and community input, and includes a core structure for governance, mapping, measuring, and managing AI risks. Additionally, it highlights the need for trustworthy AI systems that are valid, safe, secure, accountable, and fair, while also addressing harmful biases.",

Key entities include organizations like NIST, people such as Gina M. Raimondo and Laurie E. Locascio, and the framework itself. The framework is composed of functions, categories, actions, and outcomes, which are central to its structure. Relations describe how these entities interact, such as the framework being published by NIST, composed of functions, and aligned with standards and guidelines. The text also emphasizes the framework's applicability across various sectors and domains, and its role in managing AI risks, which informs the choice of relation types."

      "rephrase": "The consequences of AI systems can be positive, negative, or a mix of both, leading to opportunities or threats (Adapted from: ISO 31000:2018). When evaluating the negative effects of a potential event, risk is determined by two factors: 1) the severity of harm that could occur if the event happens, and 2) the likelihood of that event occurring (Adapted from: OMB Circular A-130:2016). Negative impacts can affect individuals, groups, communities, organizations, society, the environment, and the planet.\n\nRisk management involves organized efforts to guide and control an organization regarding risks (Source: ISO 31000:2018). While traditional risk management focuses on addressing negative impacts, this framework also aims to reduce expected negative effects of AI systems and identify ways to enhance positive impacts. By effectively managing potential harms, we can create more trustworthy AI systems that benefit individuals, communities, organizations, and ecosystems. Risk management helps AI developers and users understand the impacts of their systems and recognize the limitations and uncertainties involved, which can improve overall performance and trustworthiness, increasing the chances that AI technologies will be used beneficially.\n\nThe AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) is designed to adapt to new risks as they arise, which is crucial since some impacts may not be easily predicted and AI applications are constantly evolving. Although some risks and benefits of AI are well understood, assessing negative impacts and the extent of harm can be difficult.

Achieving trustworthy AI requires balancing these characteristics based on how the AI system will be used. While all these traits are related to social and technical aspects, accountability and transparency are particularly important for both the internal processes of the AI system and its external environment. Ignoring these traits can lead to increased risks and negative outcomes. The characteristics of trustworthy AI are interconnected with social behavior, the data used, the choice of AI models and algorithms, and the decisions made by developers, as well as the interactions with users who provide oversight.

Together, explainability and interpretability assist\nthose operating or overseeing an AI system, as well as users of an AI system, to gain\ndeeper insights into the functionality and trustworthiness of the system, including its out-\nputs. The underlying assumption is that perceptions of negative risk stem from a lack of\nability to make sense of, or contextualize, system output appropriately. Explainable and\ninterpretable AI systems offer information that will help end users understand the purposes\nand potential impact of an AI system.\nRisk from lack of explainability may be managed by describing how AI systems function,\nwith descriptions tailored to individual differences such as the user\u2019s role, knowledge, and\nskill level. Explainable systems can be debugged and monitored more easily, and they lend\nthemselves to more thorough documentation, audit, and governance.\nPage 16\n\n\nNIST AI 100-1\nAI RMF 1.0\nRisks to interpretability often can be addressed by communicating a description of why\nan AI system made a particular prediction or recommendation. (See \u201cFour Principles of\nExplainable Artificial Intelligence\u201d and \u201cPsychological Foundations of Explainability and\nInterpretability in Artificial Intelligence\u201d found here.)\nTransparency, explainability, and interpretability are distinct characteristics that support\neach other. Transparency can answer the question of \u201cwhat happened\u201d in the system. Ex-\nplainability can answer the question of \u201chow\u201d a decision was made in the system. Inter-\npretability can answer the question of \u201cwhy\u201d a decision was made by the system and its\nmeaning or context to the user.\n3.6\nPrivacy-Enhanced\nPrivacy refers generally to the norms and practices that help to safeguard human autonomy,\nidentity, and dignity. These norms and practices typically address freedom from intrusion,\nlimiting observation, or individuals\u2019 agency to consent to disclosure or control of facets of\ntheir identities (e.g., body, data, reputation).",
      "rephrase": "Explainability and interpretability are important for both those managing AI systems and the users of these systems. They help everyone understand how the AI works and how trustworthy it is, including its results. The main idea is that people often feel uncertain about AI because they can't easily understand its outputs. AI systems that are explainable and interpretable provide information that helps users grasp their purpose and potential effects. To reduce risks from a lack of explainability, it's helpful to explain how AI systems operate, adjusting the explanations based on the user's role, knowledge, and skills. Explainable systems are easier to debug, monitor, and document, which supports better governance. Risks related to interpretability can be managed by explaining why an AI system made a specific prediction or recommendation. Transparency, explainability, and interpretability are different but interconnected features. Transparency answers 'what happened,' explainability answers 'how' a decision was made, and interpretability answers 'why' a decision was made and its significance to the user. Privacy involves protecting individuals' autonomy, identity, and dignity by limiting intrusion and allowing people to control their personal information.",

The connections between various activities and the AI stakeholders can make it hard to predict the effects of AI systems reliably. For instance, early choices about the goals of an AI system can change how it behaves and what it can do, while the environment where it is deployed (like the end users or those affected) can influence the outcomes of the AI's decisions. Therefore, even well-meaning actions in one part of the AI lifecycle can be negatively impacted by decisions and conditions in later stages.\n\nThis complexity and varying levels of visibility can create uncertainty in managing risks. By anticipating and addressing potential negative risks, organizations can reduce this uncertainty and improve their decision-making process. The information collected during the MAP function helps prevent negative risks and guides decisions related to model management and whether an AI solution is appropriate. The results from the MAP function are crucial for the MEASURE and MANAGE functions. Without understanding the context and being aware of risks, effective risk management is challenging. The MAP function aims to improve an organization\u2019s ability to identify risks and other contributing factors.\n\nImplementing this function is more effective when it includes insights from a diverse internal team and involves collaboration with people outside the team that created or deployed the AI system. The level of engagement with external partners, end users, and affected communities may vary depending on the risk level of the AI system, the composition of the internal team, and the organization's policies.",

AI systems also bring a set of\nrisks that are not comprehensively addressed by current risk frameworks and approaches.\nSome AI system features that present risks also can be beneficial. For example, pre-trained\nmodels and transfer learning can advance research and increase accuracy and resilience\nwhen compared to other models and approaches. Identifying contextual factors in the MAP\nfunction will assist AI actors in determining the level of risk and potential management\nefforts.\nCompared to traditional software, AI-specific risks that are new or increased include the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 The data used for building an AI system may not be a true or appropriate representa-\ntion of the context or intended use of the AI system, and the ground truth may either\nnot exist or not be available. Additionally, harmful bias and other data quality issues\ncan affect AI system trustworthiness, which could lead to negative impacts.\n\u2022 AI system dependency and reliance on data for training tasks, combined with in-\ncreased volume and complexity typically associated with such data.\n\u2022 Intentional or unintentional changes during training may fundamentally alter AI sys-\ntem performance.\n\u2022 Datasets used to train AI systems may become detached from their original and in-\ntended context or may become stale or outdated relative to deployment context.\n\u2022 AI system scale and complexity (many systems contain billions or even trillions of\ndecision points) housed within more traditional software applications.\n",

According to the NIST AI RMF 1.0 document, AI risks differ from traditional software risks in several ways. While both can have significant impacts on organizations and society, AI systems introduce unique risks that current risk management frameworks do not fully address. Some features of AI, like pre-trained models and transfer learning, can improve research and accuracy, but they also come with risks. Understanding the context in which AI operates helps identify these risks and manage them effectively.\n\nNew or heightened risks specific to AI compared to traditional software include:\n- The data used to create AI systems may not accurately represent the intended context, and there may be issues with bias and data quality that affect trustworthiness.\n- AI systems rely heavily on data for training, which can be complex and voluminous.\n- Changes made during the training process can significantly impact how the AI system performs.\n- Training datasets may lose their relevance or become outdated compared to the context in which the AI is deployed.\n- The scale and complexity of AI systems can be much greater, with some containing billions or trillions of decision points, compared to traditional software.",
